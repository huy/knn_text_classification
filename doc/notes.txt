# Solution for populate synonym's table automatically

**Modeling the problem**

The task is similar to problem of text classification. Text classification is the problem of identifying
which category a new observed document (aka test document) belongs, on the basis of a training set of data 
containing documents whose category membership is known.

In our case, a training set is new code table in which each code represents one category, the code's 
description represents an object of known category - known document. New observed document - unknown document
is a code of a previouly enriched code table. 

The problem will be solved by using two popular algorithms 

* Multinominal Naive Bayes
* K-Nearest Neighbor

Both algorithms are implemented using correspondent pseudo code taken from Text Book "Introduction to 
Information Retrieval" by Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan & Hinrich Sch√ºtze.
 
**Multinominal Naive Bayes**

In this algorithm we will try to find a known document that is "closest" to a test document then assign the test
document to the same category of the "closest" known document.

**K-Nearest Neighbor**

In this algorithm we will try to find a K - known documents that are "closest" to a test document then assign the test
document to the same category of these documents with majority.
