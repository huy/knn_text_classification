# Solution for populate synonym's table automatically

## Modeling the problem

The task is similar to problem of text classification. Text classification is the problem of identifying
which class a new observed document (aka test document) belongs, on the basis of a training set of data 
containing documents whose class  membership is known.

In our case, a training set is new code table in which each code represents one class, the code's 
description represents a document of known class - known document. New observed document - unknown document
is a code of a previouly enriched code table. 

The problem is solved by using K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. The KNN algorithm is implemented using corresponding 
pseudo code taken from Text Book [Introduction to Information Retrieval](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/) 
by Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan & Hinrich SchÃ¼tze.
 
**K-Nearest Neighbor by Weighted Proximity**

In K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm we look for a K - known documents (K is predefined parameter) that are "nearest" 
to a test document then assign the test document to the same class of these documents with highest sum of proximity 
if the sum of proximity exceeds predefined threshold from interval of 0 to 1. 

Documents are represented using tf*idf vector space model. The proximity between two document is cosine similarity 
of their vectors. 

**Term's processing**

In order to use the algorithm, code's description as well as description of it's synonyms are tokenized, 
stop worlds are removed and terms are stemmed. 

* the list of stop words is borrowed from ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS of http://lucene.apache.org/
* the implementation of stemming is borrowed from http://tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/java.txt 

## Implementation

Except borrowed stemming code in Java, code is written in Scala. 

**Build**

To build project we need sbt tool, which can be install following https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki.

    $sbt
    >compile # compile
    >test  # run test
    >proguard # create self executed jar

**Run**

Using java

    java -jar ./target/scala-2.9.2/text_classification_2.9.2-1.0.min.jar

Using scala

    scala ./target/scala-2.9.2/text_classification_2.9.2-1.0.jar
    
Using sbt

    sbt
    >run

**Examples**

Enrich new code table in file `new.txt` using previously enriched table `existing.txt` and write result after enrichment to `out.txt`

    scala -jar text_classification_2.9.2-1.0.jar --algo=3nn --new-table=new.txt --existing-table=existing.txt \
    --result-table=out.txt --threshold=0.4

Enrich new code table in file `new.txt` using two codes from previously enriched table `existing.txt`, write debug info and the result to stdout

    scala -jar text_classification_2.9.2-1.0.jar --algo=3nn --new-table=new.txt --existing-table=existing.txt \
    --result-table=out.txt --threshold=0.4 --code-id=311,142 --debug

**File format of a code table**

Code table is ascii file with the following format e.g.

    1	Administrator  
    -	system administrator 
    -	network administrator
    2 	Assistant
    -	Assistant #src/test/data/sample.txt 311 automatic 0.94
    -	assistant store manager #src/test/data/sample.txt 311 automatic 0.94

Each code's definition start with a line containing id of the code and its description, following by severals line repesenting synonyms.
These lines begin with `-` then the synonym and can has a comment after `#`. The comment indicates originals of the synonym and how it
get merged into the current table.
